# Event Sourcing with DCB in PHP
Example project (Proof of Concept) with Event Sourcing in PHP using the 'Dynamic Consistency Boundary' pattern (DCB).

## Background
'Dynamic Consistency Boundary' pattern is introduced by Sara Pellegrini in 2023 as a thought process (rethinking Event Sourcing).
Explained in her talk: ["The Aggregate is dead. Long live the Aggregate!"](https://sara.event-thinking.io/2023/04/kill-aggregate-chapter-1-I-am-here-to-kill-the-aggregate.html).

Currently, existing Event Sourcing frameworks rely on a consistent boundary within _aggregates_ (primary citizen), as explained in 'The blue book':

> Cluster the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS into AGGREGATES and define boundaries around each.
Choose one ENTITY to be the root of each AGGREGATE, and control all access to the objects inside the boundary through the root. Allow external objects to hold reference to the root only.

_From "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans (the 'blue book')._

However, Event Sourcing with DCB has some advantages/solves some pitfalls over a traditional aggregate setup.

### Reusable domain events
In traditional event sourcing (if we call it like that already ðŸ˜›), thereâ€™s usually a strict one-to-one relation between an aggregate and a domain event, 
which helps keep things internally consistent within each aggregate. The DCB pattern takes a different approach by loosening this rule and treating domain events as so-called _pure events_.

This opens up new possibilities for building business decision models based on selected domain events, 
also when these events spread across different domain identities.

This approach lines up well with how [EventStorming](https://github.com/ddd-crew/eventstorming-glossary-cheat-sheet) looks at aggregates. 
In EventStorming, what we typically call aggregates is nowadays seen as "systems" or "consistent business rules", making the concept easier to grasp for non-technical actors involved in the design process.

By replacing aggregates with business decision models with the DCB pattern, weâ€™re aligning more closely with EventStormingâ€™s focus on "business rules".
This brings our software closer to the actual problem space and avoids so-called _accidental complexity_ that is introduced with the translation to aggregates.

### No need for aggregate synchronization
With domain events now usable across multiple business decision models, thereâ€™s no longer a need for synchronization between aggregates.
This means that e.g. domain services, which are typically used to manage business logic that spans multiple aggregates, are not needed anymore.
Also, sagas, used to subscribe to domain events in order to synchronize with other aggregates, are not needed anymore.

### Concurrency problems
As an aggregate is based on internal consistency, two concurrent modification are impossible,
even when the modified data is (domain-wise) independent of each other.
The DCB pattern removes this blocking behavior when handled by multiple business decision models.

**But overall it removes accidental complexity which aggregates introduced, allowing to build software closer to the real world.**

## This example project
_The DCB pattern is an interesting concept, but this does not advocate to remove aggregates completely.
Instead, a hybrid solution with aggregates and business decision models is probably more likely, depending on your domain._

This example project is using a fictive domain (taken from Sara Pellegrini's blog) where students can subscribe to courses (of any kind).
Deliberately this is all what is defined for this domain, to focus on how this could be implemented when using Event Sourcing with the DCB pattern in mind.

It contains both classic aggregates (e.g. [Course](src/Domain/Course/Course.php), [Student](src/Domain/Student/Student.php)) as well as business decision models (e.g. [ChangeCourseCapacity](src/Domain/Course/ChangeCourseCapacity.php), [SubscribeStudentToCourse](src/Domain/StudentToCourseSubscription/SubscribeStudentToCourse.php), [UnsubscribeStudentFromCourse](src/Domain/StudentToCourseSubscription/UnsubscribeStudentFromCourse.php)).
